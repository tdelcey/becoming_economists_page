We are pleased to announce the release of the **French PhD Thesis Database in Economics**! This database offers extensive information on the majority of doctoral theses defended in France in the field of economics since 1900.

The database is available in `.csv` format and can be downloaded from its [Zenodo Repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14541427). Comprehensive documentation can be accessed [here](../../../../documentation/french/).

The French database is implemented as a relational database, integrating multiple interconnected data frames. It is structured around four main components:

- **Thesis Metadata**: This table contains the core information for each dissertation. Each entry corresponds to a single thesis and includes details such as the title, defense date, abstract, and other relevant metadata.
- **Edges Data**: This table captures the connections between the other three tables, linking individuals, institutions, and theses. It associates each thesis with the individuals and institutions involved in its production, thereby enabling a synthetized view of these relationships. The edges data are provided in two formats: (1) a ready-to-use format with cleaned and standardized information; and (2) a more   extensive format that allows for comparison between the original  collected data and the results of the cleaning process.
- **Institutions Data**: This table includes information on universities, laboratories, doctoral schools, and other institutions associated with the dissertations. Each entry corresponds to a single institution.
- **Individual Data**: This table contains information on the individuals involved in the dissertations, including authors, supervisors, and jury members. Each entry corresponds to a single individual.

The data used in this project comes from three mains sources: 

- Theses.fr: [https://theses.fr/](https://theses.fr/)
- Sudoc:  [https://www.sudoc.fr/](https://www.sudoc.fr/)
- IdRef:  [https://www.idref.fr/](https://www.idref.fr/)
