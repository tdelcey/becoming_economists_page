    "text": "Sources\nThe data used in this project comes from three mains sources:\n\nTheses.fr: https://theses.fr/\nSudoc: https://www.sudoc.fr/\nIdRef: https://www.idref.fr/\n\nThese sources are the result of the work of the ABES (l’Agence bibliographique de l’enseignement supérieur) who produced metadata and APIs regarding research and superior education. The data of the three sources mentionned above are under the Etabab “Open Licence”.3\n\nTheses.fr is a comprehensive repository for PhD dissertations defended in French institutions since 1985.4 It includes metadata such as the title of the dissertation, author, date of defense, institution, supervisor, abstract, etc. The database covers a wide range of disciplines, providing access, in some cases, to digital theses.\nSudoc stands for “Système Universitaire de Documentation”. It is a union catalog that includes references to various documents held in French academic and research libraries. It covers books, journal articles, dissertations, and other academic works. The Sudoc database includes metadata like title, author, publication date, and library locations where the documents can be found. It is a key resource for academic research in France, providing a broad overview of available scholarly materials. Regarding PhD, it allows to find dissertations defended before 1985, and to recover relevant metadata.\nIdRef stands for “Identifiants et Référentiels pour l’Enseignement supérieur et la Recherche”. It is a database focused on managing and standardizing the names and identifiers of authors and other contributors to academic and research works. It provides authority control for names used in academic cataloging, ensuring consistency and aiding in accurate attribution of works. IdRef is used in conjunction with Sudoc and other databases to support the management of bibliographic data in the French higher education and research sectors. In our project, it allows us to find additional data on individuals and institutions.\n\nOur data-building approach focuses on ensuring consistency and quality while preserving the integrity of the original information. We relies on two principles to build this database:\n\nNo Data transformation: Our work primarily involves data collection, categorization, and cleaning. We intentionally minimized transformations, restricting them to only minor and non-impactful adjustments. Specifically, we avoided altering the cell values of the original data, instead encoding any modifications in new columns.5 The complete edges data frame keeps a track of our transformations.\nDisambiguation: We aimed to disambiguate theses and associated entities (individuals and institutions) as thoroughly as possible. Disambiguation involves identifying and distinguishing between entries with similar descriptions. This process is essential to avoid duplicated data or to merge distinct entries. To address this, we assigned a unique identifier to each entity. The identifiers provided by the Agence Bibliographique de l’Enseignement Supérieur (ABES) through IdRef served as our primary source for unique identifiers. In cases where ABES identifiers were unavailable, we generated our own unique identifiers to maintain consistency and accuracy."

The field remains unaltered by our work and can take on a wide range of values, as indicated by the number of distinct entries (696).\naccessible: a binary variable indicating whether the fulltext is accessible or not (data coming only from theses.fr).\ntype: the type of the thesis. Type can take 6 values: Thèse, Thèse d’État, Thèse complémentaire, Thèse de 3e cycle, Thèse de docteur-ingénieur, Thèse sur travaux. All categories are derived from categories found in Sudoc.\ncountry: the country where the thesis was defended, i.e. France. \nurl: the url of the thesis on theses.fr or Sudoc websites\nduplicate_of: a list of thesis_id that indicate duplicated thesis. We identified duplicates but did not remove them to preserve the maximum information from the raw sources. This variable allows users to handle duplicates using their preferred strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporary identifiers\n\n\n\nWhen we were unable to provide an ABES identifiers for a thesis or entity, we created our own unique “temporary identifiers” coded as follows temp_X_Y, X representing the source of the original information (either “sudoc” or “thesesfr”) and Y being a randomly generated unique number. We refer to these identifiers as temporary because they may be replaced in future updates by ABES identifiers, either as ABES updates its sources or as we improve our cleaning process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\n\n\nThe language variables may be important for exploring issues related to the internationalization of economics. However, the raw source data exhibited a notable error rate in the classification of title and abstract languages: French titles were frequently mislabeled as English, and vice versa. To address this issue, we employed language prediction models to correct the misclassified information when possible. For a detailed explanation of the cleaning process, refer to Section 3.2.4.\n\n\nTable 1 shows a sample of the thesis metadata table. The thesis metadata table contains 21025 theses.

During this period, various types of theses coexisted. For instance, in the mid-1970s, it was common for scholars to first complete a “Doctorat de 3e cycle” before pursuing a “Doctorat d’État.” As a result, a single author may have produced multiple types of theses. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of theses over time, categorized by type. It should also be noted that the inclusion of thesis type in the metadata is not systematically ensured. This variability depends on the quality of metadata provided by individual institutions, which may affect the reliability of classification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailability of abstracts\n\n\n\nThe practice of providing abstracts started in the 1980s. Prior to this period, abstracts were missing (see Figure 3)."

    "section": "Edges",
    "text": "Edges\nEach line in the thesis_edge table represents a unique edge between a thesis and an entity. We define an entity as any individual or institution involved in the thesis. The edge table has five 5 columns:\n\nthesis_id: the identifier of a thesis (the same as in thesis_metadata). In the edge table, a thesis_id can have several edges. A thesis_id has at least two edges: the author and the institution where the thesis was defended.\n\nentity_id: the identifier of an entity. If it exists, it is the official “idref”, an unique identifiers created by the ABES (see https://www.idref.fr/). If not, it is a temporary identifier we have created following the strategy we used for thesis_id.\nentity_role: the role of the entity. A person, for example, may serve as an author, supervisor, referee, president, or jury member. In addition to identifying the primary institution where the Ph.D. was defended, the entity_role variable may include supplementary information we collected, such as affiliations with other institutions, laboratories, or doctoral schools (the organizations responsible for overseeing doctoral programs in French universities). This detailed information primarily applies to theses recorded in theses.fr after 1985. For data sourced from Sudoc, the value “etablissements_soutenance_from_info” of entity_role may provide additional information regarding the institutions associated with the thesis.\nentity_name: The name of the entity. It is derived from the preferred name in the official IdRef notice, or from raw information when the entity has no IdRef. See Section 3.2.5 and Section 3.2.6 for more information about names standardization.\n\nentity_firstname, the first name of the individual. Coded as missing value when the entity is an institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntity identifiers\n\n\n\nThrough the https://www.idref.fr/ platform, the ABES assigns unique identifiers to institutions and individuals involved in research in France. This system provides valuable information about entities, such as their dates of existence and the various names used to refer to entities. For example, see the entry for the former University of Paris that split after 1968. We scrapped those information to enrich our institution and individual tables (see Section 3.1.3).\n\n\nTable 2 shows a sample of the thesis edge table. We identify 100814 edges in total.

For example, to determine the exact number of theses published by the Université Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne, it is necessary to first address duplicates in the metadata tables. This can be achieved by merging entries identified as duplicates using the duplicates column.\n\nComplete Edges Data\nThe thesis_edge_complete_data allows the comparison between original data as collected on theses.fr and sudoc with the results of our cleaning process. In addition to the columns of thesis_edge, we have 4 additional columns:\n\noriginal_id: the original identifier of the entity in the raw data. This allows to see how temporary identifiers for institutions have been cleaned to find the official idref.\noriginal_entity_name: the name of the entity as in the original raw data.\noriginal_entity_firstname: the first name of the individual as in the original data source.\nsource: the source of the data.

The downloading_theses_fr.R script allows to download the .csv on data.gouv and to compress and store it in .rds format.\n\n\nSudoc\nWe systematically collect metadata on French theses archived in the Sudoc database, focusing on theses in economics. To identify theses in economics, we employ a dual-query approach:\n\nIn the main query, we search for theses with a term beginning with “econo” in the “Note de Thèse” field, which specifies the discipline of the thesis.6 The search is restricted to the period from 1900 to 1985, as theses from subsequent years are systematically cataloged in Theses.fr. Here is the query allowing to retrieve thesis records.\nOne issue specific to French history is that economic research was predominantly conducted within law faculties until the 1960s. Consequently, in a second query, we focus on theses where the term “droit” (law) appears in the field “Note de Thèse” and a word beginning with “econo” is present in the title. This search is restricted to the period 1900–1968, aiming to identify theses classified as law theses prior to 1968 that likely pertain to economics. Here is the query, allowing to retrieve thesis records.\n\nThe scraping_sudoc_id.R collects the thesis records URLs. Then, the scraping_sudoc_api.R allows to query the Sudoc API to retrieve structured metadata for each thesis, including information such as title, author, defence date, abstract, supervisor and other relevant details.

    "text": "Cleaning\nThis section outlines the data cleaning process. Starting with the raw sources, we clean and harmonize the data to enable seamless merging of the two datasets, Sudoc and theses.fr. Following this, we construct our five data tables.\n\nSudoc\nThe cleaning_sudoc.R script cleans the Sudoc data. It has two main objectives: managing duplicated identifiers and transforming the raw Sudoc data into a structured dataset. The process involves evaluating the data quality and restructuring the raw sources to ensure consistency and facilitate future merging with the theses.fr dataset.\nThe script handles duplicate identifiers, which fall into two categories:\n\nTrue duplicates: these occur when the same dissertation appears multiple times with identical identifiers and authors but differing defense dates. In such cases, the script retains the most recent record, as it is more likely to contain accurate metadata.\nFalse duplicates: these arise when the same identifier is linked to different authors, typically due to data entry errors from ABES. To resolve this, the script generates unique identifiers by appending a counter to the “national number thesis” field.\n\nMost of the column of the final data are created here from the raw data. Two variables deserves a particular attention:\n\nyear_defence:\n\nFor some theses, multiple defense dates are retrieved for a single observation (line). In such cases, the earliest date is selected, as it is more likely to correspond to the original, unfinished thesis.\nWhen dates differ significantly, manual checks are performed.\nAnomalous dates outside the query range (1899–1985) are cleaned to maintain consistency.\n\ntype:\n\nThe type of the thesis is determined from various Sudoc metadata fields, reflecting the diversity of thesis types in the French system before the 1984 reform.\nThesis types are recoded into consistent categories, such as “Thèse d’État” and “Thèse de 3e cycle.” Entries that are not doctoral theses (e.g., master’s dissertations) are excluded to focus solely on relevant records.\nIf the thesis type cannot be determined, the variable is assigned the generic value “Thèse.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe value “Thèse” of the Type variable is default value when we cannot identify a specific type of thesis.\n\n\nNote that the value of Language are also standardized to align with ISO conventions, ensuring compatibility with theses.fr data.\nThe final dataset is divided into four tables that constitute the relational database: metadata, edge, person, and institution. For entities without official identifiers, temporary IDs are generated to enable future identification and disambiguation. Temporary identifiers are under the format temp_X_Y, X representing the source of the original information (either “sudoc” or “thesesfr”) and Y being a randomly generated unique number.\n\n\nTheses.fr\nThe cleaning_thesesfr.R script focuses on cleaning and structuring metadata for theses related to economics, extracted from the theses.fr database. The methodology closely parallels the approach used for Sudoc: assessing data quality, standardizing raw data, and preparing the dataset for integration with Sudoc data.\nA specific challenge addressed in this script involves filtering out theses that were incorrectly classified as economics-related in the query results. After resolving this issue, the script applies the same steps as those used for Sudoc data, including the categorization and harmonization of variables, to ensure consistency and facilitate merging.\nAs with the Sudoc data, temporary IDs are generated for entities lacking official identifiers from IdRef. These temporary IDs support future identification and disambiguation efforts.\n\n\nMerging\nThe merging_database.R script processes four types of tables—theses, edges, persons, and institutions—generated from both the Sudoc and Theses.fr datasets. The script merges these tables in pairs to produce four intermediate merged tables. These intermediate data frames are subsequently cleaned and standardized in the following scripts.\n\n\nMetadata\nThe script cleaning_metadata.R is designed to clean and harmonize theses metadata. Metadata from Sudoc and theses.fr is derived from a variety of local institutions and individuals, which often results in inconsistencies and errors. This script focuses on addressing two major challenges: language detection and duplicates identification.\n\nLanguage detection: To ensure consistency across metadata about titles and abstracts, the script employs the cld3 (Ooms 2024) and fastText (Bojanowski et al. 2016) models for robust language identification. Key tasks include:\n\nVerifying that titles and abstracts in French and English fields contain text in the correct languages. Discrepancies are resolved by reassigning text to appropriate fields.\nMissing French or English titles and abstracts are supplemented using auxiliary columns from the scraped data (title_other and abstract_other) when relevant.\nTitles and abstracts in full uppercase are converted to sentence case to enhance readability.\nPlaceholder text, irrelevant symbols, and uninformative entries are removed, with such entries replaced by missing values (NA).\n\nDuplicates: Duplicated thesis records are a common issue, arising from cross-database redundancy (the same thesis may appear in both Sudoc and theses.fr) and intra-database redundancy (a thesis may be registered multiple times by different institutions within a single database). To address this, we developed a duplicates detection algorithm. The core of the process involves grouping titles by authors and comparing all possible title pairs within each group. We use the Optimal String Alignment (OSA) distance as the primary metric for these comparisons. OSA estimates the number of operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions, and adjacent character transpositions) needed to align two strings. This method is implemented using the stringdist package (van der Loo 2014). We adjust the distance measure by the number of character in the title. Each potential duplicate is manually reviewed. In alignment with the project’s overall approach, we do not remove duplicates but instead flag them in a new column, duplicates. Table 6 provides an example of distinct theses in the sources that we flagged as duplicates.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Example of theses identified as duplicates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOur script allows also for handling duplicates manually. If you spot an undetected duplicate, please let us know.\n\n\n\n\nInstitutions\nThe script cleaning_institution.R is dedicated to standardizing and improving the quality of institution data.\nInstitution names extracted from metadata have been stored in a separate table, thesis_institution. This script focuses on cleaning and standardizing these names to ensure consistency and accuracy. A key goal is replacing temporary institution identifiers (id_sudoc_temp or id_thesesfr_temp) created in merging_database.R with the official IdRef identifiers. This process relies on matching institution names and thesis defense dates, accounting for historical changes in institutional structures (e.g., the division of the University of Paris after 1968) and carefully handling ambiguous cases.\nThe script employs a manually curated table that associates regular expressions (RegEx) for institution names with their corresponding IdRef identifiers. The table also includes the institutions’ dates of creation (date_of_birth) and dissolution (date_of_death) to set clear temporal boundaries for identifier replacement. For instance, if the institution name matches “University of Paris” and:\n\nThe thesis defense occurred before 1968, the identifier is replaced with the identifier of the historic University of Paris, as it was the only university in Paris at the time.\nIf the thesis is defended after 1968, the string “Université de Paris” is ambigous since it describes several distinct institutions. In this case, we kept the temporary identifier because we are not able to resolve the ambiguity.\n\n\n\nIndividuals\nThe script cleaning_persons.R is designed to standardize and enhance the quality of person data.\nThe script first enriches individual records by incorporating information from the idref_person_table, built from scraping_idref_person.R. When a name entity is linked to an IdRef identifier, supplementary details about the individual—such as organization affiliations, birth date, and relevant links (e.g., Wikipedia pages)—are added from the IdRef database. Additionally, raw names extracted from Sudoc or theses.fr are replaced with the standardized names provided by IdRef.\nA key focus of the script is addressing inconsistencies in person identifiers. Challenges include:\n\nVariations in names: The same individual may appear with slight name differences (e.g., “Jean A. Dupont” vs. “Jean Dupont”).\nDuplicate identifiers: A single individual may be associated with different identifiers across or within datasets (e.g., as an author in Sudoc in 1983 and as a jury member in theses.fr in 1999).\n\nWhile the script strives to identify and group such cases, disambiguating person identifiers is constrained by the risk of homonyms. For example, two individuals with identical names may represent distinct persons. Due to this ambiguity, it is not possible to merge identifiers confidently.\nTo address potential ambiguities, the script introduces a new column, homonym_of, which groups potential homonyms. For each person, the homonym_of field lists the identifiers of individuals with identical or highly similar names. This approach prevents premature merges while flagging possible relationships for users to investigate further.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Example of persons identified as homonym\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the script enhances the gender column using data from the IdRef source. For individuals with missing gender values, we leverage French census data to predict gender. If a first name is associated with a single gender in more than 95% of cases, we assign that gender to the individual.\nThis approach has the advantage of simplicity but presents obvious limitations for handling some important cases (e.g., unisex names or cultural variations). The threshold of 95% is also arbitrary. To clarify the origin of the information, whether from IdRef or census data, we did not modify the gender column, and we created a new column, gender_expanded."

At this point, the project focuses on three countries:\n\nFrance, collecting data from the Sudoc and Theses.fr databases;\nThe United States, collecting data from the list of PhD granted in US universities, published each year by the American Economic Review and then the Journal of Economic Literature;\nThe United Kingdom, collecting data from the EThOS catalogue.\n\n\nLatest news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease of the French Ph.D. database (version 1.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Delcey, Aurelien Goutsmedt\n\n\nJan 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items",

    "text": "We are pleased to announce the release of the French PhD Thesis Database in Economics! This database offers extensive information on the majority of doctoral theses defended in France in the field of economics since 1900.\nThe database is available in .csv format and can be downloaded from its Zenodo Repository. Comprehensive documentation can be accessed here.\nThe French database is implemented as a relational database, integrating multiple interconnected data frames. It is structured around four main components:\n\nThesis Metadata: This table contains the core information for each dissertation. Each entry corresponds to a single thesis and includes details such as the title, defense date, abstract, and other relevant metadata.\nEdges Data: This table captures the connections between the other three tables, linking individuals, institutions, and theses. It associates each thesis with the individuals and institutions involved in its production, thereby enabling a synthetized view of these relationships. The edges data are provided in two formats: (1) a ready-to-use format with cleaned and standardized information; and (2) a more extensive format that allows for comparison between the original collected data and the results of the cleaning process.\nInstitutions Data: This table includes information on universities, laboratories, doctoral schools, and other institutions associated with the dissertations. Each entry corresponds to a single institution.\nIndividual Data: This table contains information on the individuals involved in the dissertations, including authors, supervisors, and jury members. Each entry corresponds to a single individual.\n\nThe data used in this project comes from three mains sources:\n\nTheses.fr: https://theses.fr/\nSudoc: https://www.sudoc.fr/\nIdRef: https://www.idref.fr/\n\nIf you use our data or scripts, please cite the following reference: Delcey Thomas, and Aurélien Goutsmedt.
