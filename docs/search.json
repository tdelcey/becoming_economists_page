If not, it is a temporary identifier we have created.\nyear_defence: the date of the defence of the thesis. It covers the period between 1899 and 2023.\nlanguage_1 and language_2 are the languages of the thesis. It is a harmonized variables of the respective language variables found in SUDoc and These.fr.\ntitle_fr: the title of the thesis in French.\ntitle_en: the title of the thesis in English.\ntitle_other: the title of the thesis in another language.\nabstract_fr: the abstract of the thesis in French.\nabstract_en: the abstract of the thesis in English.\nabstract_other: the abstract of the thesis in another language.\nfield: the field of the thesis. It is a harmonized variable of the respective field variables found in SUDoc and These.fr.\naccessible: a binary variable indicating whether the fulltext is accessible or not.\ntype: the type of the thesis. Type can take 6 values: Thèse, Thèse de 3e cycle, Thèse de docteur-ingénieur, Thèse d’État, Thèse complémentaire, Thèse sur travaux. All categories are categories found in SUDoc (see Tip 1).\ncountry: the country where the thesis was defended (à supprimer ?)\nurl: the url of the thesis, linking to the theses.fr website or the sudoc.fr website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRaw source data had an important rate of error in the title and abstract language: title in french were in the english column and vice versa.

To illustrate this point, it is very easy to spot that the string “Paris I” and “Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne” are the same entity but we cannot be sure that “Thomas Delcey” authoring a Ph.D in 2021 is the same person than “Thomas Delcey” supervising a Ph.D. in 2022.

The data of the three sources mentionned above are under the Etabab “Open Licence”.1\n\nTheses.fr:\nTheses.fr is a comprehensive repository for PhD dissertations defended in French institutions since 1985.2 It includes metadata such as the title of the dissertation, author, date of defense, institution, supervisor, abstract, etc.. The database covers a wide range of disciplines, providing access, in some cases, to digital theses.\n\n\nSUDoc (Système Universitaire de Documentation):\nSUDoc is a union catalog that includes references to various documents held in French academic and research libraries. It covers books, journal articles, dissertations, and other academic works. The SUDoc database includes metadata like title, author, publication date, and library locations where the documents can be found. It’s a key resource for academic research in France, providing a broad overview of available scholarly materials. Regarding PhD, it allows to find dissertations defended before 1985, and to recover relevant metadata.\n\n\nIdRef (Identifiants et Référentiels pour l’Enseignement supérieur et la Recherche):\nIdRef is a database focused on managing and standardizing the names and identifiers of authors and other contributors to academic and research works. It provides authority control for names used in academic cataloging, ensuring consistency and aiding in accurate attribution of works. IdRef is used in conjunction with SUDoc and other databases to support the management of bibliographic data in the French higher education and research sectors. In our project, it allows us to find additional data on individuals and institutions."

This keyword captures terms like “économie” or “Economique” since SUDoc ’s search function is case-insensitive and ignores accents. The time frame is limited to 1900–1985, as dissertations from later years are systematically cataloged in Theses.fr. Here is the query, allowing to retrieve thesis records.\nSecond query: We search for dissertations where “droit” (law) is specified in the “Note de Thèse” field, and where a term starting with “econo” appears in the title. This search is limited to 1900-1968 to capture dissertations classified as law theses before 1968 that likely focus on economics. Here is the query, allowing to retrieve thesis records.\n\nThe scraping_sudoc_id.R collects the thesis records URLs. Then, the scraping_sudoc_api.R allows to query the SUDoc API to retrieve structured metadata for each thesis, including information such as title, author, defence date, abstract, supervisor and other relevant details. These metadata are stored in an .xml file, which we then parse to extract the relevant information. The .xml is structured according to “tags” and “codes” that are explained here."

    "title": "Documentation: the French database",
    "section": "Data cleaning",
    "text": "Data cleaning\nOur data-cleaning approach focuses on ensuring consistency and quality while preserving the integrity of the original data. Key information, such as the institution of the thesis, is standardized to facilitate analysis. However, we keep this standardized data separate from the raw data, ensuring transparency in our modifications and avoiding any loss of original information.\nThe first step of the cleaning process involves merging data extracted from Theses.fr and SUDoc. We ensure compatibility in the metadata format and structure, allowing for a seamless integration of the two datasets. After merging, the dataset is organized into three main components:\n\nThesis Metadata: This component contains core details about each thesis. Each line represents a thesis record, including information such as the title, defense date, abstract, and other relevant details.\nIndividual Data: Each line represents an individual involved in the thesis, such as authors, supervisors, or jury members.\nInstitutions Data: This includes all mentioned universities, laboratories, doctoral schools, and other institutions associated with the theses.\n\nThis relational database connecting different data frames facilitates well-structured, accurate analysis across different dimensions of the dataset (see the Description of the database section for details on the final content of the database).\n\nCleaning SUDoc data\nThe cleaning process for SUDPC data in 1_FR_sudoc_cleaning.R is designed to address inconsistencies, remove duplicates, and standardize information across the dataset. This step aims to correct errors and inconsistencies linked to the SUDoc extraction, as well as to allows the consistency and merging with theses.fr data. Further cleaning steps are necessary and implemented after this merging.\n\nDuplicate Management\nThe cleaning process first identifies and resolves duplicate records, which fall into two categories:\n\nTrue duplicates: These occur when the same thesis is listed multiple times with identical identifiers and authors but differing defence dates. The process retains the most recent record as it is more likely to reflect the correct metadata.\nFalse duplicates: These occur when the same identifier is shared by different authors, often due to data entry errors. To resolve these, unique identifiers are created by appending a counter to the nnt, ensuring data integrity without introducing ambiguity.\n\n\n\nDate Standardization\nDefence dates (year_defence) are cleaned and standardized by: - Choosing the oldest date for theses with multiple dates, as the earliest date is more likely to reflect the actual defence event. - Flagging and logging anomalous dates outside the query range (1899–1985) or those with large gaps between associated dates for manual inspection.\nThis approach minimizes errors stemming from incomplete or conflicting date records and ensures chronological accuracy.\n\n\nStandardization of thesis types and Languages\nThesis types are deduplicated and recoded into consistent categories (e.g., “Thèse d’État”, “Thèse de 3e cycle”). Records that are not doctoral theses (e.g., master’s dissertations) are filtered out to focus exclusively on relevant entries. Similarly, language codes are standardized to align with ISO conventions and ensure compatibility with related datasets.\n\n\nOutput Preparation\nThe final dataset is split into four distinct outputs:\n\nMetadata Table: Core information about theses, such as titles, abstracts, dates, and types.\nEdge Table: Links between theses and associated entities (individuals and institutions).\nPerson Table: A unique list of individuals involved in theses (authors, jury members, etc.).\nInstitution Table: A unique list of institutions linked to theses (universities, laboratories, etc.).\n\nBy structuring the cleaned data in this way, the workflow facilitates downstream analysis, such as network modeling and bibliometric studies, while maintaining transparency in data transformations. This cleaning pipeline ensures the dataset’s reliability and usability for academic and research purposes.\n\n\n\nCleaning Theses.fr data\nThe 2_FR_thesesfr_cleaning.R is dedicated to cleaning and structuring metadata for theses related to economics extracted from the Theses.fr database. The primary goal is to prepare the dataset for integration with SUDoc data.\nThe cleaning process begins with filtering the dataset to retain only theses categorized under economics disciplines. A simple keyword search (e.g., “econom” or “économ”) identifies potential entries, followed by the exclusion of specific fields unrelated to economics (e.g., legal or geographic disciplines, like “Droit économique”). Additionally, basic data quality checks ensure that all entries have valid and unique identifiers (nnt) to prevent issues during downstream processing.\nThe cleaned dataset is then divided into structured components for better usability. The metadata table (thesesfr_metadata) includes core thesis attributes such as titles, abstracts, defense dates, and disciplines. The edge table (thesesfr_edge) captures relationships between theses and associated entities, including authors, jury members, and affiliated institutions. Separate tables for individuals (thesesfr_person) and institutions (thesesfr_institution) are derived from the edge table. Temporary IDs are generated for entities without official identifiers to facilitate later identification and disambiguation.\n\n\nMerging theses.fr and SUDoc data\nThe 3_FR_merging_database.R script consolidates data from the two primary sources, SUDoc and Theses.fr, to create unified datasets. The process involves merging metadata, relationships (edges), individuals, and institutions while resolving duplicate entries across sources. Metadata is harmonized by removing redundancies and retaining unique thesis identifiers. Edge tables are cleaned to link theses with associated individuals and institutions, ensuring consistent identifiers for entities that appear in both databases. Separate tables for individuals and institutions are deduplicated and aligned for further cleaning and standardization.\n\n\nCleaning thesis metadata\nThe 4_FR_cleaning_thesis_metadata.R is designed to clean and standardize metadata for theses, with a primary focus on managing titles and abstracts. The modification implemented in this script directly transformed the original columns, but all transformations are checked by eye and does not change the informational content of the columns. More directly: it mainly corrects errors in the original recording of information in SUDOC and Theses.fr.\nThe script addresses several key challenges: - the normalization of formatting the titles and abstracts - the detection and imputation of missing values - the verification of language consistency and the reallocation of misplaced titles and abstracts - the identification of duplicate thesis records\nA central component of the script is the cleaning of titles and abstracts. Titles and abstracts written in full uppercase are transformed into sentence case to enhance readability. Placeholder text and irrelevant symbols are also removed, with problematic entries replaced by missing values (NA).\nFor cases where either French or English titles and abstracts are missing, the script employs auxiliary columns originally scraped (title_other and abstract_other) to fill gaps when relevant. Indeed, language detection is used to validate these imputed values, leveraging both the cld3 [@R-cld3] and fastText [@fastText2016b] models for robust identification.\nLanguage consistency is verified across the metadata. Titles and abstracts are checked to ensure that French and English columns contain text matching their intended language. Discrepancies are resolved by reassigning text to the correct fields.\n\n\nCleaning institutions\nThe 5_FR_cleaning_institution.R script aims to standardize and improve the quality of institution data. So far, any institution names mentioned in the metadata have been extracted and stored in a separate table. This script focuses on cleaning and standardizing these names to ensure consistency and accuracy in the dataset. Our goal is to replace temporary institution identifiers (id_temp) we have created in 3_FR_merging_database.R with the official IdRef identifiers (id_ref) to ensure consistency and accuracy in the dataset.\nThis replacement relies on matching the institution names and thesis defense dates. The process accounts for historical changes in institutional structures (e.g., the splitting of the University of Paris after 1968), ensuring that ambiguous cases are handled carefully. The core of the script is a manually defined table that associates regular expressions (regex) for institution names with their corresponding idref identifiers. This table also includes the dates of creation (date_of_birth) and dissolution (date_of_death) of institutions to set clear boundaries for replacement. For instance, if an institution’s name matches “University of Paris” and the thesis was defended before 1970, the identifier is replaced with that of the historic University of Paris, as it was the only university in Paris at the time.\nThis approach ensures that institution identifiers are accurate and consistent across the dataset, enabling robust analysis and interpretation of the data. We kept the temporary identifier and did not assign an idref institution names when we were enable to resolve the ambiguity. For instance, if the institution is the “University of Paris” for a thesis defended after 1968 (and that could be Paris 1, Paris 2, Paris 3, etc.) we kept the temporary identifier. Each ambigous entity name kept its temporary identifier even when the name is the same.\n\n\nCleaning individuals\nThe 6_FR_cleaning_persons.R script focuses on standardizing and improving the quality of individual data.\nFirst, this script processes and cleans data for individuals associated with theses by merging and normalizing information of persons (e.g., authors, supervisors, etc.) from the idref_person_table. When a name entity is associated to an idref identifier, the script adds supplementary information on the person provided by the IdRef database (organization, birth date, relevant links such as wikipedia pages, etc.).\nSecond, we try to clean and unify person identifiers. We know that the same person can have slightly different names (e.g., “Jean A. Dupont” and “Jean Dupont”) or that the same person can have the same names but different identifiers. It is particularly the case for person present in both SUDoc and Theses.fr databases. For instance, the same person can be the author of a thesis in SUDoc and a member of the jury of another thesis. Contrary to institution tables, however, we are enable to replace temporary identifiers by idref identifiers for individuals because of the risk of homonyms. If two persons have the same name, we cannot be sure that they are the same person. Two authors of two different theses could have the same name or it could be the same person doing two theses.\nTo address this issue, we create a new column homonym_of that group potential homonyms. For each person, the variable homonym_of give the list of person identifiers that are her homonyms. a new column homonym_of that group potential homonyms. For each person, the variable homonym_of give the list of person identifiers that are her homonyms."

Therefore, we include the year of defense in the regression to control for this increasing proportion.\n\\[ \\theta_{d,k} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * gender_d + \\beta_2 * year_d + \\epsilon_{d,k} \\]\n\n\nShow the code\n# create covariates and check level \ncorpus_in_stm &lt;- readRDS(here(website_data_path, \"corpus_in_stm.rds\"))\n\nmetadata &lt;- corpus_in_stm$meta %&gt;% \n  as_tibble %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    year_defence = as.numeric(year_defence),\n    gender_expanded = as.factor(gender_expanded),\n    gender_expanded = relevel(gender_expanded, ref = \"male\")\n  )\n\n\n# check level factor variable\n# levels(metadata$gender_expanded)\n\n# create regression formula \n\nformula_str &lt;- paste(\"~\", \"gender_expanded + s(year_defence)\")\nformula_obj &lt;- as.formula(formula_str)\n\nestimate_effect &lt;- estimateEffect(formula_obj,\n                                  stm,\n                                  metadata = metadata,\n                                  documents = corpus_in_stm$documents,\n                                  uncertainty = \"Local\",\n                                  nsims = 25)\n\nsaveRDS(estimate_effect, here(website_data_path, \"estimate_effect.rds\"))\n\n\n\nPlotRegression table\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nestimate_effect &lt;-readRDS(here(website_data_path, \"estimate_effect.rds\"))\n\nsummary &lt;- summary(estimate_effect)\n\nsummary_tibble &lt;- summary$tables %&gt;% \n  purrr::imap_dfr(~ {\n    tibble(\n      topic = .y,  # Extract topic number\n      term = rownames(.x),  # Covariate names\n      estimate = .x[, 1],  # Coefficients\n      std_error = .x[, 2],  # Standard errors\n      t_value = .x[, 3],  # Confidence interval lower bound 95\n      p_value = .x[, 4],   # Confidence interval upper bound 95\n    )\n  })\n\ngender_estimate &lt;- summary_tibble %&gt;% \n  filter(term == \"gender_expandedfemale\") \n\ngg &lt;- gender_estimate %&gt;%\n  mutate(tooltip = paste(\"Estimate:\", estimate)) %&gt;%\n  left_join(top_terms_prob, by = \"topic\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    topic = reorder(topic, estimate),\n    effect = ifelse(estimate &gt;
