<p>In this blog, we use the Structural Topic Model (STM) to analyze the effect of gender on Ph.D.&nbsp;students’ choice of research topics in economics in France. STM integrates probabilistic topic modeling with regression analysis to examine how document metadata influences two key aspects of the topic model: topic content and topic prevalence. If you are not familiar with probabilistic topic models, we recommend reviewing the first <a href="../..\application/stm_title/">blog post</a> and the related references for background information before proceeding.</p>
<p>In this <a href="../..\application/stm_title/">blog post</a>, we examined how the year of defence influences the prevalence of a topic, i.e.&nbsp;the probability that this topic is used during this year. The underlying intuition is that thesis topics are strongly shaped by the period in which they are written; what is considered a contribution evolves alongside the social and academic context of a given time.</p>
<p>However, this approach can be refined further. When predicting topic prevalence using the year of defence, we acknowledge this “evolving social context” but do not specify the mechanisms driving these changes. Additional variables could provide a clearer explanation of authors’ topic choices. For instance, one of the most significant transformations in the French Ph.D.&nbsp;landscape is the increasing proportion of women pursuing doctoral degrees in economics. Are there research topics that male Ph.D.&nbsp;students are more likely to explore, while female Ph.D.&nbsp;students tend to focus on others?</p>
<p>Let’s explore this issue!</p>
<section id="exploring-the-data" class="level1">
<h1>Exploring the data</h1>
<p>To run our topic model, we use the abstracts (<code>abstract_fr</code>) as the main textual input. As previously demonstrated <a href="../..\application/stm_title#fig-textual_data">here</a>, abstracts provide significantly better data than titles for training a topic model; however, they are only available from the early 1980s. Consequently, we limit our analysis to the past four decades. This period also marks a sharp increase in the proportion of female authors, making it particularly relevant for examining gender dynamics in academic publishing.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the data to analyze the gender distribution in the French Ph.D.&nbsp;dataset. The individuals table includes two distinct variables, <code>gender</code> and <code>gender_expanded</code>, which provide information about the gender of individuals (e.g., authors, supervisors).</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>gender</code> variable contains raw information obtained from the <a href="https://www.idref.fr/">IdRef</a> database.</li>
<li>The <code>gender_expanded</code> variable is our enhanced version, which imputes missing gender values using French census data.</li>
</ul>
<p>More information on these variables can be found in the <a href="../..\documentation/french#sec-cleaning-individuals">documentation</a> of the French database available on this website. For this analysis, we will use the <code>gender_expanded</code> variable.</p>
<p>The <code>gender_expanded</code> variable is derived from the <code>thesis_individual</code> table, whereas our textual data come from the <code>thesis_metadata</code> table. To link these variables, we must use the <code>thesis_edge</code> table, which associates each thesis identifier (<code>thesis_id</code>) with the corresponding entities (<code>entity_id</code>), and so to the author of the thesis.</p>

<p>The practice of including an abstract became common in the early 1980s, but few abstracts were available for theses defended in earlier decades. A closer examination shows, however, that these were added by librarians who created the entries. Therefore, it is reasonable to filter out theses defended before 1980.</p>
<p>To run our probabilistic topic model, we follow the usual pre-processing steps, as described in this <a href="../..\application/stm_title/">post</a>. The primary difference in this instance is the inclusion of a few custom stopwords to address highly redundant terms frequently found in abstracts, such as “chapitre” (<em>chapter</em>) or “thèse” (<em>thesis</em>). We can then run the topic model. For a corpus of 11,000 abstracts, starting with <span class="math inline">\(K=100\)</span> (the number of topics) provides a reasonable basis for exploration.</p>

<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p><a href="#fig-theta_summary" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> presents the top 20 topics ranked by average prevalence. For each topic, the most probable words from the topic content (based on the <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{1:K}\)</span> distributions) are assigned. Unsurprisingly, the top topics closely align with common subfields in economics, such as development economics, monetary economics, and the economics of innovation.</p>
<p>Notably, the topics appear more interpretable than those generated by the other <a href="../..\application/stm_title#fig-theta_summary">model</a> we ran with <code>title_fr</code>. This can be attributed both to the use of a richer source of information and to the fact that we are covering a more recent period, in which topics are more recognizable to contemporary audiences.</p>

<p>Now that we have estimated our topics and ensured their interpretability, we can examine the extent to which the author’s gender predicts topic prevalence for a given document. Given the increasing number of female authors over time, topics that are more prevalent in recent theses are more likely to be associated with female authorship. Therefore, we include the <code>year of defense</code> in the regression to distinguish between trendy recent topics and topics more commonly chosen by female authors:</p>

<p><a href="#fig-gender_effect" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a> presents the significant estimates for the covariate gender_expanded (with a p-value &lt; 0.1). The y-axis represents the topics, while the x-axis shows the effect of being female on the expected topic prevalence. For instance, being a woman increases the prevalence of topic 35 in a document by 0.0077. Given that the average prevalence of topic 35 is around 0.012, this effect accounts for a significant proportion of the topic’s overall prevalence.</p>
<p>The first obvious conclusion from this analysis is the presence of a strong gender bias in the choice of thesis topics. Male authors are more likely to work on theoretical topics, particularly in macroeconomics, whereas female authors are more associated with applied topics, especially in the fields of health, labor, and education.</p>

<p>For a more detailed historical analysis, it is also possible to look for an interaction effect between <code>year_defence</code> and <code>gender_expanded</code> in the regression if you are interested in exploring how gender-based topic choices evolve over time:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \theta_{d,k} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * gender_d * year_d + \epsilon_{d,k} \]</span> For instance, certain topics may have been strongly associated with one gender in the early 1980s before becoming neutral or even dominated by the other gender. Here, the estimate give, for each value of <code>year_defence</code>, the effect of being female on the expected prevalence of a given topic.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-regression_interaction" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4</a> presents the results of such an analysis. For each <code>year_defence</code> and <code>gender_expanded</code>, we compute the expected topic prevalence of topic 35, 53 and 92. Topics 35 and 53 are examples of topic prevalence strongly associated with women and men, respectively. Topic 92 provides a more interesting insight: while this topic is generally associated with male authors, it was mostly prevalent in women’s theses until the mid-1990s.</p>
