## Pr√©sentation

This site aims to create a database of Ph.D. dissertations defended in economics during the 20th and 21st centuries across different countries. The team is actually working on three countries:

- France, using data from the SUDOC and Theses.fr databases;
- United States, gathering data from the lists of dissertations published annually by the American Economic Review and later by the Journal of Economic Literature;
- United Kingdom, using the EThOS catalog.
