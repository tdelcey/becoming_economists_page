In this first blog article, we explore the evolution of topics of French theses over the 20th and early 21st centuries.

### Exploring data 

Note that the French sources used to create our database contained duplicate theses. It is necessary to address these duplicates appropriately before conducting any analysis. Duplicates can be easily identified using the `duplicates` column in the `thesis_metadata` table. In the example script below, we identify duplicate entries and retain the record with the most recent `year_defence`, assuming that the most recent version of the thesis is the most relevant.^[Actually some other considerations can lead the choice of the row to keep, such as selecting the row with more extensive information.]

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE 
#| label: "Loading data and handling duplicates"

thesis_metadata <- readRDS(here(FR_cleaned_data_path, "thesis_metadata.rds"))

# PRE-CLEANING 

# manage duplicate
duplicates <- thesis_metadata %>%
   filter(!is.na(duplicates)) %>%
   group_by(duplicates) %>% 
   # when the line has a duplicate, group and keep the older value
   slice_min(year_defence, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE)

thesis_metadata_no_duplicate <- thesis_metadata %>% 
  filter(is.na(duplicates)) %>% 
  bind_rows(duplicates)
```

The primary textual data providing information on thesis topics are the titles (`title_fr` and `title_en`) and the abstracts (`abstract_fr` and `abstract_en`). The first question to consider is the choice of language. Historically, French PhD theses were predominantly written in French. Over time, however, they were increasingly translated into English or even primarily written in English.

To determine the main language of a thesis, one can refer to the `language` variable. This variable is sourced directly from Sudoc and Theses.fr, and it reflects the primary language of the thesis. As shown in @fig-main_language, English has become the predominant language for French PhD students, but this shift has occurred only recently. Additionally, theses in English are often accompanied by a French translation of the title and abstract. Therefore, to analyze the evolution of topics over an extended period, the French textual data are more relevant.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE 
#| label: fig-main_language
#| fig-cap: "In which language are the theses written?"

data_summary <- thesis_metadata_no_duplicate %>% 
  # if language is not fr or en, becomes "other"
  mutate(language = ifelse(str_detect(language, "fr|en"), language, "other"),
         language = ifelse(!is.na(language), language, "other")) %>% 
  # calculate share of each languages by year 
  add_count(year_defence, name = "freq_thesis") %>%
  count(language, year_defence, freq_thesis, name = "freq_language") %>% 
  mutate(share = freq_language/freq_thesis) %>% 
  filter(year_defence > 1994) 

# plot 
plot <- data_summary %>% 
  filter(language != "other") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year_defence, y = share, color = language)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, span = 0.5) +
  scale_color_wsj(labels = c("English", "French")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(seq(1995, 2020, 5), 2023), expand = c(0,0.5)) +
  theme_hc() + 
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Proportion of theses",
       color = "Thesis language")
  

print(plot)
```

While abstracts are undoubtedly a richer source of textual data, they are less rarely available. As shown in @fig-textual_data, writing an abstract only became common practice starting from the 1970s. In this blog article, we will thus exploit only the `title_fr` column to understand the evolution of topics from 1900.  

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
#| label: fig-textual_data
#| fig-cap: "Availability of titles or abstracts"

# abstract available

data_summary <- thesis_metadata_no_duplicate %>% 
  mutate(title_available = ifelse(!is.na(title_fr), 1, 0),
         ab_available = ifelse(!is.na(abstract_fr), 1, 0)) %>% 
  # add_count(title_available, year_defence, name = "n_title") %>%
  # add_count(ab_available, year_defence, name = "n_ab") %>%
  mutate(n_ab = sum(ab_available),
         n_title = sum(title_available),
         .by = "year_defence")

# distribution 

p1 <- data_summary %>% 
 # filter(ab_available == 1) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_defence, y = n_ab), color = ggthemes_data$wsj$palettes$red_green$value[1]) +
  labs(color = "",
       y = "theses with a french abstract") +
  theme_hc() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, max(data_summary$n_title)))

p2 <- data_summary %>% 
  # filter(title_available == 1) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = year_defence, y = n_title), color = ggthemes_data$wsj$palettes$red_green$value[2]) +
  labs(color = "",
       y = "theses with a french title") +
  theme_hc()

p2 + p1
```

# Running the structural topic model

To identify "trendy topics" in our data, we use the structural topic model, a probabilistic topic model implemented in `R` through the `stm` package. 

Probabilistic topic models are a class of machine learning models designed to classify textual data into topics. In such models:

- **Documents are topic mixtures**: Each document is represented as a mixture of $K$ topics. For each document, the model estimates the probability that the document contains a given topic $k$. This is referred to as topic prevalence, denoted as $\theta_{1:D}$ where $\theta_{d}$ represents the probability distribution over topics for document $d$.
- **Topics are word mixtures**: Each topic is represented as a mixture of words from the corpus vocabulary, which is the list of unique words used in the entire corpus. For each topic, the model estimates the probability that a particular word belongs to that topic. This is referred to as topic content, denoted as $\beta_{1:K}$ where $\beta_{k}$ represents the probability distribution over the vocabulary for topic $k$.

These probabilities are estimated using a generative process. Intuitively, a topic model initializes the topic prevalence and topic content, uses them to generate a simulated corpus of documents, and then compares this simulated corpus to the observed one to adjust the topic prevalence and content. The input to a topic model is the document frequency matrix (DFM), also referred to as the document-term matrix. In this matrix, rows represent documents, columns represent unique words in the vocabulary, and cell values indicate the frequency of each word in a given document. The model evaluates how well the current $\theta_{1:D}$ and $\beta_{1:K}$ fit the corpus distribution and iteratively updates these parameters to improve the fit. For a comprehensive presentation of the generative and training process, see @blei2012probabilistic.

The `stm` package [@roberts2013structural] implemented a topic model whose main feature is to offer a framework to explore the relationship between the metadata of the documents and the prevalence of topics. The metadata helps in training a topic model and in estimating the topic prevalence over documents. Regression analysis allows to measure precisely the controlled effect of each metadata on topics prevalence.

To train our topic model, we must first prepare the data by constructing the document frequency matrix (DFM), which serves as the primary input for the `stm` package. This process begins with tokenization---the identification of individual words in `title_fr.` Tokenization typically also includes transforming the data by removing irrelevant words, such as stopwords, to improve the quality of the analysis and computational efficiency.

In the script below, we include bigrams, which are pairs of words, when they frequently co-occur. For example, in acorpus containing economic documents, the words "interest" and "rates" might be combined into the term "interest_rates" as they often go together. 

We finally run a structural topic model for $K = 100$.^[Of course the choice of $K$ should be determined with greater care; however, starting with $K = 100$ with 20,000 documents provides a reasonable basis for exploration.]

# Analysis

For each thesis, the topic model assigns a prevalence score to each topic, indicating the probability that a specific topic is present in the thesis. Averaging these probabilities across all theses yields the average prevalence, which can provide insights into the main topics appearing in theses titles. @fig-theta_summary shows the top 20 average prevalence; for each topic we assign the most probable words from the topic content (the $\beta_{1:K}$ distributions). For instance, among the most prevalent topics, many are related to development economics.

The average prevalence provides important insights into key topics but is insufficient for analyzing how this prevalence evolves over time. A straightforward way to capture the evolution of topics over time is simply to calculate the average prevalence by year (`year_defence`). A more sophisticated approach leverages the features of the `stm` framework to predict the prevalence of each topic based on `year_defence`. In this case, the goal is not merely to describe the average prevalence in a given year but to estimate the effect of a specific year on topic prevalence. This can be expressed using the following regression model:

$$ \theta_{d,k} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * year_d + \epsilon_{d,k} $$
This regression approach allows for statistical inference by quantifying the strength and significance of the relationship between the year (`year_defence`) and topic prevalence. This enables us to formally test whether changes in prevalence over time are statistically meaningful, rather than merely observing trends in the data. @fig-prevalence_descriptive_inference compares the result of both analyses.

Note also that by applying a spline function to `year_defence`, this method is still able to capture the non-linear behavior of prevalence over time with greater precision. Check @nte-spline if you are interested in the methodology behind spline effect. 

::: {#nte-spline .callout-note collapse="true" icon=false}
## The b-spline function 

In a linear model, the estimator $\beta_1$ for a time variable, such as years, measures the marginal effect of an additional year on the expected prevalence of the topic. This linearity does not allow for the identification of non-linear effects, such as a high prevalence during the 1990s followed by a decline. To address this, we apply a b-spline function to the year to capture potential non-linear effects. Formally, our estimator for the variable $year_d$ becomes a linear combination of $n$ estimators and polynomial functions $B(x)$, also known in this context as basis functions.

$$\beta_1 * year_d = \sum_1^n \alpha_1 \times B_{1}(year_d) + ... + \alpha_{n}\times B_{n}(year_d)$$
This B-spline transformation is performed in `R` using the function  `stm::s(df = 10)`, a wrapper for the `splines::bs()` function.

The drawback of such an approach is that the estimators $\alpha_1 ... \alpha_n$ are not interpretable. Each coefficient represents the weight of a polynomial function $B_n$ in the total prevalence. Rather than focusing on the regression table, it is more insightful to directly calculate the model's expected prevalence.
::: 

The regression model is estimated using the `stm::estimateEffect()` function. While the regression could alternatively be performed using standard statistical packages in R, such as `stats::lm()`, `estimateEffect` offers an important advantage. Unlike a simple `lm(theta ~ covariates)`, `estimateEffect` accounts for the uncertainty in the topic prevalence that arises from the `stm() ` estimation. In essence, instead of directly predicting the estimated prevalence, $\theta_{d,k}$, it predicts a set of simulated prevalences, incorporating the uncertainty from the structural topic model estimation process. The core methodology is implemented in the internal function `stm::thetaPosterior()` internal function, available [here](https://rdrr.io/cran/stm/man/thetaPosterior.html). We can then compute the expected topic prevalence for each topic and for each value of `year_defence`.



```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE

# run a regression predicting prevalence with the year of defence

# create a covariate table and ensure proper it is coded with the proper format 

metadata <- corpus_in_stm$meta %>%
  as_tibble %>%
  mutate(year_defence = as.numeric(year_defence))

# create regression formula 
formula_str <- paste("~ s(year_defence)")
formula_obj <- as.formula(formula_str)

# run regression 
estimate_effect <- estimateEffect(formula_obj,
                                  stm,
                                  metadata = metadata,
                                  uncertainty = "Global",
                                  nsims = 25)


# calculate the expected prevalence for values in year_defence 

# simulate 25 prevalence using eta matrix and predict expected prevalence for 100 year_defence values in the range 1900:2023
# see details in the internal stm::plotContinuous function 

ee_year <- tidystm::extract.estimateEffect(
  estimate_effect,
  "year_defence",
  stm,
  method = "continuous") %>% 
  # add topic label 
  left_join(top_terms_prob, by = "topic")

We can now examine the evolution of topics in French theses since 1900. Figure @fig-top_max illustrates the topics with the greatest increases and decreases in prevalence over this period, measured as the difference between 1900 and 2023. Even this preliminary topic modeling provides valuable insights into the transformation of French economics.

For instance, the declining topics are characterized by terminology associated with legal vocabulary, reflecting the significant role of law faculties in shaping French academic disciplines during the first half of the 20th century. Conversely, the increasing topics predominantly feature terms related to applied and contemporary research questions, such as inequality and the environment.

It‚Äôs worth noting that while probabilistic topic models excel at exploratory analysis, they tend to perform less effectively on small textual inputs like titles. However, they demonstrate far greater accuracy and insights when applied to larger text samples, such as abstracts. This is precisely what we‚Äôll explore in our next blog post‚Äîstay tuned!
